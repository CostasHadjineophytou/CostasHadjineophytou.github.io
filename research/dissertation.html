            <p>A versatile and unified AI model collection application providing users with access to online and offline AI models in GenAI, NLP, and Computer Vision, with the following key features:</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Integrated IBM's watsonx AI models and services</li>
                <li>Individual model configurations and model chaining configurations</li>
                <li>Chatbot capabilities for interacting with LLMs</li>
                <li>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system</li>
                <li>Inferencing models and model-chains</li>
                <li>Focus on accessibility and user experience</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>AI Islands is an innovative project designed to unify and integrate various isolated artificial intelligence (AI) models, both online and offline, into a cohesive, user-driven platform. This desktop
                application, developed using .NET MAUI with a Python backend powered by FastAPI, functions
                as a versatile playground where users can seamlessly combine, experiment with, and customise AI
                models according to their specific needs. The primary focus of this specific sub-project is to integrate
                IBM's watsonx models into the AI Islands app, enabling users to tap into IBM's AI capabilities for
                tasks such as inference, configuration, and model chaining.</p>
            <br>
            <p>By linking the user's IBM watson cloud account to the app, AI Islands allows for flexible offloading
                of computation tasks to the cloud, offering an alternative to running models locally. The app simpli-
                fies the use of IBM's suite of AI services, ranging from foundation models to their natural language
                processing tools. The project also explores the enhancement of watsonx models through program-
                matic use, including the implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, where
                dataset processing is either done locally or via a watsonx embedder, thus reinforcing the Islands
                concept. Datasets can serve as the contextual base for Large Language Models (LLMs) within the
                application, which also features chatbot capabilities for interacting with these LLMs.</p>
            <br>
            <p>AI Islands exemplifies the vision of creating a flexible, customisable platform where AI models
                from multiple sources can interact, providing users with the freedom to design tailored AI systems
                that meet their unique requirements. Through this integration of IBM's advanced AI tools, the app de-
                livers a unified and user-friendly experience, making cutting-edge AI more accessible and adaptable
                for experimentation and real-world application.</p>
            
            <h2>Research Objectives</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Investigate the integration patterns between AI Islands and watsonx</li>
                <li>Analyze performance and scalability considerations</li>
                <li>Develop best practices for AI model deployment</li>
                <li>Evaluate user interaction patterns with AI services</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <p>This project primarily explores the various ways to integrate IBM's watsonx into AI Islands.
                It begins by providing the necessary background on AI models and IBM's watsonx platform,
                followed by a requirements and use case analysis, and then outlines the general structure of AI Islands.
                It then moves onto the more technical aspects, focusing on IBM Cloud programmatic access
                and the main integration of watsonx with AI Islands. This is followed by analysis of the RAG
                system and how watsonx AI models can be enhanced through their programmatic use. This project finishes with application testing, followed by a conclusion.</p>

            <h2>Impact</h2>
            <p>AI Islands represents a significant step towards promoting access to advanced AI models from multi-
                ple sources. By providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with complex AI models, it enables
                both technical and non-technical users to utilise AI across various domains. The application's flexi-
                bility in supporting different model types position it well for future advancements in AI technology.
                As new models and techniques emerge, they can be readily integrated into the platform. Moreover,
                the inclusion of features like the playground, detailed configuration options, and RAG, promotes
                experimentation and learning, potentially accelerating AI adoption and innovation across industries.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This project demonstrates the potential of creating accessible, versatile, and powerful
                AI tools that bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI research and practical, real-world applications.
                Its impact extends beyond mere technical achievement, potentially influencing how AI is perceived,
                utilised, and integrated into various sectors of society and industry</p>
